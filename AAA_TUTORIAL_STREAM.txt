	      STREAM : Satellite-based Runoff Evaluation and Mapping 
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	          TUTORIAL for the use of the Matlab STREAM CODE

	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	
	STREAM is a semidistributed conceptual hydrological model for estimating runoff and river discharge from rainfall, soil moisture, air temperature 
	and terrestrial water storage data.
	The STREAM model can be freely applied and used, just cite some the reference to the model reported below.
	The authors are highly interested to collaborate for the understanding of the model functioning and to improve its performance and applicability.

	------------------------STEP by STEP PROCEDURE TO RUN STREAM MODEL-----------------------------------------------------------------
	0. Subbasin delineation. Before to run the STREAM model, a basin delineation has to be carried out. Once selected the closure sections (Nsect) over the river, 
				 this operation allows to identify the subbasins (Nbas) of the river basin. For instance, the basin delineation could be carried out 
				 through Qgis software (https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/training_manual/processing/hydro.html?highlight=hydrological%20analysis).

				 As output of this step, at each section selected for the analysis as well as at each subbasin should be associated a unique identification
				 number. See for example the "Mississippi_basin.png" figure.
				 
       
        1. Preparation of the input data needed for run the STREAM model. The following input data have to be created to run the STREAM model:

	1.1) "input.mat": .mat struct file of gridded daily data. It contains basin_data and temperature cells for each sub-basin.
	"basin_data" contains:
	     a) date (in numeric Matlab format)
	     b) precipitation amount (in mm)
	     c) soil moisture (dimensionless: degree of saturation)
	     d) river discharge (where available in m3/s)
	     e) terrestrial water storage anomaly 
	"temperature" contains:
	     a) air temperature data (°C)
	
       For example see the "input.mat" file provided for the Mississippi river basin.  
	

	1.2) "staz_check.mat": .mat file containing information about the river discharge data over the river basin. It contains four vectors:
	     a) Dtot:           [Nobs x 1] vector containing the date (in numeric Matlab format);
	     b) ID_bas_app:     [Nsect x 1] vector indicating the number of the basin to which each section belongs.
	     c) Q_sezcontrollo: [Nobs x Nsect] matrix containing for each section daily river discharge observations.
	     d) sez_controllo:  [Nsect x 2] matrix containing the coordinate (lon, lat) of the each section.
	
        See, for example the "staz_checkMississippi.mat" file provided for the Mississippi river basin.

	1.3) distance.txt: [Nbas x Nsect] matrix containing the distance (in km) of each subbasin to the closure sections identified over the river basin.  
			   Basins that not contribute to the closure section have a distance set equal to "-1". 

        For example see the "distance_Mississippi.txt" file provided for the Mississippi river basin.

	1.4) topology.csv: [Nbas x 6] matrix containing:
	     a) first column:  the basin sorted from the first to the last according to the numeration identified at step "Subbasin delineation";
	     b) second column: equal to the first;
	     c) third column:  connection between the basins. In other word, it specifies the number of the basin in which the river of the considered basin 
		               will continue the path.
	     d) fourth column: contains logical values to indicate if the basin is a directly draining basin (-1) or an head catchment (0).
	     d) fifth column: contains the length (km) of the river stretch belonging to the basin. 
	     d) sixth column:  contains the area (km2) of the basin.    

        See for example the "topology_Mississippi.csv" file provided for the Mississippi river basin.
